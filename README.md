# RSF Utility

## Overview
RSF Utility is a modular transaction processing system designed for handling transaction payloads, settlement handling and reconciliation in the ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) ecosystem. The system provides a comprehensive solution for:

- Ingesting transaction payloads by the network participants
- Managing settlement interactions with external Settlement Agency (SA) 
- Performing reconciliation with the counterparty network participants
- Providing a intutive UI for operators (such as Finance team, Support team) and configuration of key values
- Persisting operational and audit data in MongoDB
- Exposing observability using Loki and Grafana
- Securing UI â†” API traffic with JWT and TLS
